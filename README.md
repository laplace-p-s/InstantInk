# InstantInk
InstantInk is a text editing web application. It differs from other text editing applications in that it focuses on leaving temporary notes.  
Have you ever wanted to leave a note that doesn't need to be saved as a text file, but you can't find it because the application abruptly closes?  
This application will satisfy such needs. Please pick up InstantInk and start writing anytime as long as your environment runs Python!  

## Usage
**It is assumed that Python is installed on your terminal.*
1. Clone the repository:
```cmd
> git clone https://github.com/laplace-p-s/InstantInk.git
```
2. Launch application:
```cmd
> python main.py [Your text file path]
```
3. Check the output message and access it using a web browser or other means:
```
InstantInk Ver.1.5.0
Serving at: http://localhost:8000
```
4. Done! Experience the magic of InstantInk writing!
